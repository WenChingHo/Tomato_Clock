## General info: 
A short project to practice and sum up my 1st month of coding (frontend/backend). The goal was to create an application that can be use even after the presentation. Since there are still 4 month of bootcamp left, I decided to create this tomato clock to help me stay focus and organize.


### Usage:
> Custom: Adjustable clock ranging from 5 second to 1 hr. <br>
> Preset: 25 min clock. Perfect. <br>
> Music: 4 music selection tabs. Not suitable on github so only the aesthetic remains <br>
> Day-end review: List out all the notes taken in notecard format. <br>
>   notecard function: editable, deletalbe, hidable 



## Technologies:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- JQuery
- Bootstrap
- Local storage


## Version 2 Changelog: 
- Added default notecards inside local storage so the day-end review doesn't look so empty for new users
